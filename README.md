The project is aimed at developing an online shopping portal for the customer. This is a console-based application and will have an authentication method to securely login customers to use the application. The customers can add the products to their cart and proceed to checkout and pay using multiple payment options. This project will be using files for storing data like the list of products, customer details. The files will store the product details like product name, product description, product price, and other product specifications. Files will also be used for storing login credentials of the user and other details of the user. Linked lists will be used for storing the products added to the cart and even for showing details of previous purchases of the customer.
